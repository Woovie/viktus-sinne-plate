## How to use `ergogen.yaml`

You can use the [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) software via CLI or [web](https://ergogen.cache.works/). I'd recommend web. Paste in the contents of `ergogen.yaml` in the editor on the webpage. It should automatically generate. Click Preview on the right for the last option, `main.dxf`, to see what it looks like and Download to download the file.

## Other plates

I also have a half plate at viktus-sinne-ergogen-half-plate-modified.dxf which was partially generated with ergogen, and partially modified in SolidWorks for better edges.
